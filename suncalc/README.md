# SunCalc-PWA
Progressive Web App for calculating current daylight hours relative to solstices

Currently, this app is an adaptation of an older html page which i created a few years ago.
It is based on Vladimir Agafonkin's suncalc.js library found at  https://github.com/mourner/suncalc.
I am currently using an older version of Chart.js https://github.com/chartjs/Chart.js.

I will try to update the manifest and cache url locations to work with url addressing such as rawgit so that it can be installed directly from this web page.

I may perform minor cleanup and storing of location data in local storage.
